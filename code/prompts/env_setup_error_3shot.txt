Issue title: About the lambdas and some fitting problems.
Issue description: Hi again, I keep struggling on fitting some formulas. I'm curious about those lambdas in `model.train()`. Only I can barely recognize are `lamb` ($\\lambda$ in eq. 2.20 in paper), `lamb_l1` ($\\mu_1$ in eq. 2.20 in paper), `lamb_entropy` ($\\mu_2$ in eq. 2.20 in paper). To my knowledge, if we increase `lamb_l1`, we can make network become more sparse. I don't know how to set them for that we can obtain better fitting results. Moreover, how about `lamb_coef` and `lamb_coefdiff`? `lamb_coef` I think it's a penalty strength for spline coefficient (scale_sp in KANLayer), but I'm not quite sure how to set `lamb_coefdiff`.\r\n\r\nCould you give me some advices or share some experiences about this?\r\n\r\nAnother interesting finding:\r\nI'm fitting a formula that I already simplified it to $y = (-1.154) * x_1 + (-0.203) * x_2$. I used hellokan example code to try fitting and it worked well. When I changed to real-world data (I have checked the data, it shows the error less than 1e-17 by using formula above), however, I cannot fit it well even though I use the same model and train settings. So, I'm curious about how this happened. Any thoughts? (oh, the differences between toy set and real set is the data distribution, real ones are skewed)\r\n\r\n

Issue title: Question about derivation of gradients of loss w.r.t. C and E.
Issue description: Hi, many thanks to the team for coming up with this optimisation!\n\nMay I ask how are these derived?\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4cc8be13-f6a1-4ac3-832b-a7815ce0b08d)\n\nAlso, how is the gradient of loss w.r.t.
